            <p>Alexis Mareta Bellinger, known in reputable circles as The Coolest Person Who Has Ever Lived was shepherded into this world, a cuddly chubby cherub on July the 24th in the year of our Lord Nineteen Hundred and Ninety to Mark Douglas and Bobbie Jean Bellinger.</p> 
            <p>Even as a small child, Alexis was fond of toast, books, and cats; her first feline friend being a Turkish Angora named Angel. Her love of reading began with The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein, a tear-jerker of the highest order. She started writing as a wee one, scribbling bad adventure stories in spiral notebooks.</p> 
            <p>In school, she studied communications and pre-med (Don’t ask. It’s a long, long, long, long story.) But she has since given that up to pursue her childhood dreams of being an author, an ibuprofen popping, watered-down-black-coffee chugging author. </p> 
            <p>She lives in Chicago. When she isn’t reading, writing, or coding, she likes to volunteer and watch ghost shows. </p>
