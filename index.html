        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>Alexis Mareta Bellinger, known in reputable circles as The Coolest Person Who Has Ever lived was shepherded into this world, a cuddly chubby cherub on a hot summer’s day, July the 24th in the year of our Lord Nineteen Hundred and Ninety to Mark Douglas and Bobbie Jean Bellinger (yes, that’s her mother’s name and no, it is not short for Roberta.)</p> 
        <p>Even as a small child, Alexis was fond of toast, books, and cats; her first feline friend being a Turkish Angora named Angel. Her love of reading began with The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein, a tear-jerker of the highest order. She tried her hand at writing in spiral notebooks from an early age, writing bad adventure stories about a trio of female soldiers.</p> 
        <p>In school, she studied communications and pre-med (Don’t ask. It’s a long, long, long, long story.) But she has since given that up to pursue her childhood dreams of being an author, an ibuprofen popping, watered down black coffee chugging, author. </p> 
        <p>She lives in Chicago. When she isn’t reading, writing, or coding, she likes to volunteer and watch ghost shows. </p>
